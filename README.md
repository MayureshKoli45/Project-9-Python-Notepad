# Project Python Notepad

Making a Notepad in Python using Tkinter

To make this Notepad i have used object oriented programming approch.

In this repositary I am adding the python code and icon file which are used to make this Notepad.

After writing the code you can convert .py file to .exe file but make sure that .exe file and icon file should be in same folder.
